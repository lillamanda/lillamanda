### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm making a career change from administrative jobs and social work to programming. 
Currently working on Scrimbas front-end-developer path, alongside my own projects and portfolio.

You can also visit my website to look at my portfolio and see what I'm up to :D 
Also, feel free to reach out for whatever reason

Have a wonderful day!
